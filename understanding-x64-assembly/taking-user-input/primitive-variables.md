# Primitive Variables

## Note

We have 4 primitive data types: `char`, `int`, `float`, `double`. But we will talk only about `char` and `int`. The same rules applies to `float` and `double` .

## Premise

What are the different ways in which we can declare variables?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  int num1;
  int num2 = 40;
}
```

We will talk about char and int.

Initialized vs Uninitialized

In-program declaration vs user-input based filling of uninitialized variables.
