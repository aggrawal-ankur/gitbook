# Complex Types

## Premise

We have pointer, array, structure, union, enum and type definition in complex data types.

We will start by array





Variable Length Declaration

1.  Length defined before initialization&#x20;

    ```
    int n = 5;
    int arr[n];
    ```
2. Length populated later in the program based on computation.
3. Length taken as an input later.
