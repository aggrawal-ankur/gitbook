# A Guide To x64 Assembly

To start reverse engineering, I thought it would be great to have a basic idea of assembly.

These are a few articles I have written while documenting my journey.

These are no longer raw because the raw ones were very redundant, plus incorrect. Therefore, I have polished them.

I learned assembly in **May 2025** and these were written at that time only.

I have polished them in **August 2025**.

Consider them as a starting point, not an ultimate source of truth. They can be incorrect as well.

This is the original git repository for the project, [GitHub](https://github.com/hi-anki/x86_64-assembly).

Expect grammatical errors, typos, inconsistent formatting, inconsistent structure, especially in the original GitHub repository. Here, it is a lot more polished.



Keep learning!
