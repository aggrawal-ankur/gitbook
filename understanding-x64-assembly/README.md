# Understanding x64 Assembly

To start reverse engineering, I thought it would be great to have a basic idea of assembly.

I learned assembly for a month in **May 2025**.

Later in **August 2025**, I felt the need to go deeper into it, plus, the existing notes were very redundant and wrong. So, I started polishing the existing ones and created the new ones as I progressed.

Consider them a starting point, not an ultimate source of truth. They can be incorrect and I keep correcting them as I find.

Expect grammatical errors, typos, inconsistent formatting and structure because grammar is not my priority right now.

I have tried to keep sentences as short as possible, which sometimes come at a cost of poor grammar.



Lets dive deep into assembly.
