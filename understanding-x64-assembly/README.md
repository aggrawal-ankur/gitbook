# Understanding x64 Assembly

Understanding low level systems is about understanding how things work at assembly level.

We are not going to study assembly alone. It is going to be a mixture of C and assembly.

We will discuss how C constructs exist in assembly. How abstractions in C are translated to assembly.

I don't expect a mastery in C, normal understanding of programming is expected. Although it is not really required because we scratch the surface before diving in anyways. So, yeah.



Enjoy.
