# Functions && Stack: The Inseparable Two

_**August 15 and 16, 2025**_

## A Note Before Diving In

Earlier I have tried to keep them distinct. But, in the end, I found them so tightly coupled that exploring them individually makes no sense and unnecessarily complicates things further.

Therefore, we are going to explore them together.

Everyone knows stack as a data structure, the push/pop operations etc. And everyone knows what are functions. So, we are not going to repeat that theory.

## The basic idea behind stack

We know that memory is a flat-array at low level. Stack approaches that memory sequentially.

Stack as a memory management technique works exactly like a stack of plates in real life.

* The first plate is at the bottom and every other plate comes above it (_pop_).
* The last plate is the top one (\*_top_).
* When we take out plates, it happens from the top, not bottom (_pop_).

Why stack grows downward?

* _Checkout the_ [_process memory layout_](../all-roads-to-memory/general-process-layout-in-virtual-memory.md) _article. It explains it the best._

_**The whole addressable memory is not managed with stack. There are multiple techniques for multiple purposes.**_

## What makes something a function?

1. A function has a universe of its own, with its memory allocation and individual function calls.
2. A function can receive arguments.
3. A function has a return context.
4. A function can return values to the callee.

If something can explain functions at best, it is **code reusability**. It allows you to not repeat the code. This is what writing modular code is about, right?

We know that labels combined with jump statements help us achieving control flow. In case of iteration, we were able to reuse the code to some extent.

The problem with jump statements is that they are absolute in nature. There is no context for returning. If I have to return to the label which called this second label, the jump would be absolute, meaning, I would return to the start of the callee label, not where the callee label had called that second label.

This lack of context limits code reusability, which is paramount to functions.

***

Now the question is, how can we create labels such that they can emulate a function? We already know everything that makes up a function. Now the question is about finding something that can provide all of this.

* And the answer is **stack**.

## How stack qualifies for function management?

Primarily there are 2 parts to function management.

1. Managing the scope of one function.
2. Managing the scope of nested function calls.

Everyone has some experience with C. You create a `main` function and call `printf` from `stdio.h` to print `Hello, World!\n`.

* `printf` itself is a function, which uses other internal functions to perform the task it is meant to.
* Just imagine how many functions there would be? Lets say, 4, including `main` and `printf`.

We would not appreciate one function accessing the variables inside another function, right? But we want other functions to access a limited part of other functions, right? **That's the problem of scope**.

We would like to pass a function some arguments that it depends on external functions.

When we call `printf` from `main` , we would not appreciate `main` finishing before `printf`. We want it to wait, right? **That's the problem of lifecycle.**

Every function would have its own variables, which we would not appreciate to be accessible out of them. **Again, a problem of scope.**

When one function calls another function, we want the callee function to return to the caller function, so that it can know it has finished and can continue its execution. Maybe we want to return somethings to the caller function. **That's the problem of return context and return values.**

Now that we know the pain points, its time to see how stack solves these problems.

### How stack fits in?

Close your eyes and imagine a stack of plates.

* The last plate, which is on the top, is always taken out first.
* When more plates come after getting washed, they come on the top of the existing stack.
* Plates can't be taken out from middle.

Isn't this the same thing we are looking to manage the order and lifecycle of function calls?

* Until the callee is not finished, caller can't execute further.

***

Close your eyes again and imagine a stack of office files, organized from high priority to low priority, each containing a number of pages.

* Each file is a case and each case has its own data collection, studies and outcomes.

Isn't this the same thing we are looking for to manage storage for individual functions?

* Each function gets its own universe where its declarations and calls reside.

***

Close your eyes one last time and imagine adding and removing plates from the stack.

Can you see stack smoothly lining up with our priorities?

* There is `main` which calls `printf`. A stack frame is created. The execution control is transferred to it.
* When `printf` is finished, the control naturally returns to `main` , without any extra managerial logic.
* When `scanf` is called, another stack frame is created. And the execution is transferred to it. And when it finishes, the control returns back `main`.
* Each stack frame is isolated, so the previous frame or the next frame can't mess with it.

***

I hope that this was explicit and verbose enough for this who question why only stack! I hope this gives a broader overview of stack as methodology, not a data structure.

Now the next question would be, how functions actually exist in assembly. Let's see.

## Introducing Procedures

In simple words, a procedure is just a code symbol with jump statements and some clever usage of stack.

A procedure is a named, reusable block of code that performs a specific task, can accept input (arguments), has proper memory-management and can return a result â€” while managing control flow and memory context safely.

### Anatomy Of A Procedure

A procedure is composed of four core components:

1. **Header** (label) is the name of the function.
2. **Prologue** (entry setup) represents the clever use of stack.
3. **Body** represents the function body.
4. **Epilogue** (cleanup and return)

### Management Pointers

To use stack cleverly, implement stack frames and return context, we need some general purpose registers, reserved for some specific purposes in the System V ABI.

<table><thead><tr><th width="175">Pointer Register</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>rsp</code></td><td>Stack pointer register; holds a pointer to the top of the stack.</td></tr><tr><td><code>rbp</code></td><td>Base pointer register; stack frame pointer.</td></tr><tr><td><code>rip</code></td><td>Instruction pointer register; holds the address of the next instruction.</td></tr></tbody></table>















## The Ultimate Question: Why functions In C return only one value?
