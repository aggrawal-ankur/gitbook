# Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is **Ankur Agarwal**. I am from India.

I am interested in low level systems engineering.

Here I publish my polished notes.

I don't have peers who share the same drive, who have the same hunger for deep understanding of low level systems. If you are like me, please don't hesitate to reach out at my [email](mailto:manageme@protonmail.com).

I don't use any social media as it drives me insane. I just want to study and having NO DISTRACTIONS enables exactly that.

Thank you.
