# Storage Classes

_**August 14 and 15, 2025**_

***

## Introduction

In simple words, storage classes guide the compiler to manage the allocation of variables in the memory.

There are primarily 4 thing associated to a variable which are needed to managed.

1. Where in the memory the variable would be stored (**location**)?
   1. Registers?
   2. Stack?
   3. Heap?
   4. .data?
   5. .bss?
2. How long the variable should exist and be accessible (**lifetime**)?
3. Who can access that variable? Where that variable can be accessed from (**scope**)?
4. Whether the variable has a default initial value when uninitialized or it will be garbage?

## Storage Classes

You may ask why the default storage class stores variables on stack. What's the logic behind it?

* The answer lies in how function calls exist and managed at low level.
* In simple words, each function call gets a stack frame in the stack region for that process.
* These frames are stacked over each other. You would not appreciate a function accessing a variable defined in another function without receiving it in its own arguments.
* Those rights are enforced by stack frames and that is why the `auto` storage class or the default storage class makes the variables inside a function call or block stack allocated because it protects them.
* For a more deep dive, explore the article where I have discussed stack as a memory management approach. [Link](../approaches-to-memory-management/stack.md).
