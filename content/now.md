*Got the idea to manage this on October 06, 2025*

Right now I just finished polishing my existing hello world write ups, where I corrected wrong mental models, reorganized concepts. rephrased sentences for clarity and removed redundant parts to a certain extent.

In that journey, I have found that it lacks a lot of pieces. Plus, it needs an even bigger restructure as the idea is not just to preserve how I learned things, but to create the roadmap that I wished existed. That will take time.

So, now I am focusing on adding those missing pieces, which will take some time as I need to read some documentations for that. After that I will continue exploring hello world dynamically with gdb, followed by dlmalloc exploration.
