*Got the idea to manage this on October 06, 2025*

Just finished polishing my existing "hello world" write ups, where I corrected the wrong mental models, reorganized concepts, rephrased sentences for clarity and removed the redundant parts to a certain extent.

I have found that my write ups lacks a lot of crucial information. Also, fragmented knowledge is reducing reusability and increasing redundancy.

To strengthen my mental model, I am restructuring everything. I am also focusing on English this time.
