# Welcome To The World Of Low Level Systems

Hi. My name is **Ankur Agrawal** and I love low level systems and reverse engineering.

I am a lifelong student from India.

Here I publish my polished notes.

I write to organize my understanding, not for social credits.

English is not my first language and I am not here to write perfect English. So, grammatical erros are inevitable. But I keep on polishing my notes so that I have the most clear articulation possible at any point in time.

If you read my notes consistently, you'll often notice significant changes in the structure and organization of both the files and the content in them because I absolutely love knowledge management.

To me, knowledge management is paramount. I keep on organizing and polishing so that I can keep finding patches in my understanding and remove them. It's not a bug, it's a important feature in my whole functioning.

I am mentioning all of this so that I can do the work guilt-free, otherwise I feel like I am decepting myself, fooling myself. As said by Sir Richard Feynman, *"don't fool yourself and you are the easiest to fool"*. I just don't want to listen and praise Mr. Feynman, but put those learnings into action and improve my life.

I don't have peers who share the same drive, who have the same hunger for deep understanding of low level systems. If you are like me, please don't hesitate to reach out at my [email](mailto:manageme@protonmail.com).

I don't use any social media as it drives me insane. I just want to study and having NO DISTRACTIONS enables exactly that.

If my notes can help you, I am more than happy and grateful for it.
- Open source community has made everything free, which is why I am able to learn so much for free.

Thank you.
