## Setup

You remember the dynamic section?

```
Dynamic section at offset 0x2de0 contains 26 entries:
  Tag                  Type             Name/Value

 0x0000000000000000    (NULL)           0x0
```

We can classify the entries in the `Type` field based on when the interpreter goes to them.

<table><thead style="text-align:left"><tr><th width="160">Phase Of Action</th><th width="336">Type Used</th><th>Significance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>NEEDED</td><td>Load shared libraries</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>JMPREL, RELA</td><td>Relocation Time</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>GNU_HASH, STRTAB, SYMTAB</td><td>Lookup data for relocation</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>STRSZ, SYMENT, DEBUG, PLTGOT, PLTRELSZ, PLTREL, RELASZ, RELAENT</td><td>Metadata for relocation</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>FLAGS_1, VERNEED, VERNEEDNUM, VERSYM, RELACOUNT</td><td>Some more info</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>INIT, INIT_ARRAY, INIT_ARRAYSZ</td><td>Setup before main</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>FINI, FINI_ARRAY, FINI_ARRAYSZ</td><td>Setup after main</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>NULL</td><td>End</td></tr></tbody></table>

So far, we know that the first thing that the interpreter does is to load the shared libraries.

* In our case, it is `libc.so.6`.

After all the shared libraries are loaded, the interpreter goes about relocation.

We know that we have two relocation tables in our binary.  Also, there are two entries in the dynamic section regarding relocation, these include `JMPREL` and `RELA`. The question is, which one the interpreter is going to go at first?

* To find the answer to this question, we have to understand a simple concept, called **binding**.

### Binding

Binding refers to process of resolving the actual address of a symbol. Although binding can be of various types, we are concerned about two types for now.

1. **Eager Binding:** Here, the symbol is resolved immediately.
2. **Lazy Binding:** Here, the symbol is resolved only when it is required for the first time.

Every entry in the `.rela.dyn` table undergoes eager binding because it includes symbols which are primarily used in the startup code, the code which gets run before the `main()` of our source code.

Every entry in the `.rela.plt` table undergoes lazy binding because it includes symbols which are primarily used in the actual source code of the binary.

But why does lazy binding exist?

Lets have a look at the following code.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>

int main(void){
  int input;
  printf("Enter 0 to exit OR 1 to sleep: ");
  scanf("%d", &input);

  if (input==0){
    printf("Exiting.....\n");
  }
  else{
    sleep(10);
    printf("Sleeping for 10 seconds.....\n");
    printf("Exiting.....\n");
  }
}
```

Now, it entirely depends upon the user input whether sleep function has to be execute or not.

* If you resolve it before it is used, it will create a very minute delay as the startup code will execute late. But it is unnoticeable.
* Big code bases have thousands of such conditions. I hope the delay would be significant there?

Lets have a look at this another piece of code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int input = atoi(argv[1]);

  if (input == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  else {
    sleep(10);
    printf("Sleeping for 10 seconds.....\n");
    printf("Exiting.....\n");
  }

  return 0;
}

```

This one is slightly modified. It takes input as an argument.

* Here, even `printf()`'s usage is dependent on the argument completely.
* What if the user input 0? `printf()` would never run, right? Then what is the point of resolving its address?

Lazy binding is a solution to this problem.

**Note: The address is resolved when the symbol is referenced for the first time. After that, no more resolution is required.**

There also exist a very genuine question that big code bases have too many functions, and if the address for every symbol in the source code is resolved like this, isn't this going to create a runtime overhead?

* Absolutely right.
* I mentioned earlier that there exist multiple kinds of binding, but we are concerned about two for now. Lazy binding is a solution, not the only solution. And as we will advance we will learn about them later as well.
* But keep this in mind that this binary only requires the knowledge of these two. So, we are not going to touch them soon.

***

I guess we have find the answer to our question. The interpreter would go to `RELA` entries first because they require eager binding. So, what we are waiting for?

## Introducing Relocations

The interpreter uses the `RELA` entry to jump to the `.rela.dyn` relocation table. `RELA` entry in the dynamic section has a value of `0x550` and we can verify that the `.rela.dyn` table is also located at the same offset by this line `Relocation section '.rela.dyn' at offset 0x550 contains 8 entries:` .

To revise, a relocation entry can be read as: _at offset in the section, replace the placeholder address of the symbol with its actual address._

These are the relocation entries in the `.rela.dyn` table.

```
Relocation section '.rela.dyn' at offset 0x550 contains 8 entries:
  Offset          Info            Type            Sym. Value     Sym. Name + Addend
000000003dd0  000000000008  R_X86_64_RELATIVE                      1130
000000003dd8  000000000008  R_X86_64_RELATIVE                      10f0
000000004010  000000000008  R_X86_64_RELATIVE                      4010
000000003fc0  000100000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.34 + 0
000000003fc8  000200000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  _ITM_deregisterTM[...] + 0
000000003fd0  000400000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  __gmon_start__ + 0
000000003fd8  000500000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  _ITM_registerTMCl[...] + 0
000000003fe0  000600000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  __cxa_finalize@GLIBC_2.2.5 + 0
```

The `Info` field is 8 bytes long, although here it is 6 bytes, which is I am also wondering why readelf is not showing the remaining 2 bytes, but leave it.

* The upper 8-bytes refers to the symbol index value and the lower 8-bytes refers to the relocation type.

### \`R\_X86\_64\_RELATIVE\` Relocation

```
  Offset          Info            Type            Sym. Value     Sym. Name + Addend
000000003dd0  000000000008  R_X86_64_RELATIVE                      1130
```

Its symbol index is 0 and the relocation type is 8, which resolves to `R_X86_64_RELATIVE`.

* Entries of type 8 doesn't require any symbol lookup.
*   `Offset` is where we have to write the result. And the result is calculated as follows:&#x20;

    ```
    *(Offset) = Base Address of the binary + Addend
    ```
* In simple words, take the base address of the binary and add the value in the `Sym. Name + Addend` field to it. Now write the obtained value at the mentioned offset. Relocation is done.
* ```
  relocation_address = base_addr + 0x3dd0;
  value_to_write = base_addr + 1130;

  *(relocation_address) = value_to_write
  ```

The remaining two entries are relocated in the same manner.

```
000000003dd8  000000000008  R_X86_64_RELATIVE                      10f0
000000004010  000000000008  R_X86_64_RELATIVE                      4010
```

### \`R\_X86\_64\_GLOB\_DAT\` Relocation

```
  Offset          Info            Type            Sym. Value     Sym. Name + Addend
000000003fc0  000100000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.34 + 0
000000003fc8  000200000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  _ITM_deregisterTM[...] + 0
000000003fd0  000400000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  __gmon_start__ + 0
000000003fd8  000500000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  _ITM_registerTMCl[...] + 0
000000003fe0  000600000006  R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT  0000000000000000  __cxa_finalize@GLIBC_2.2.5 + 0
```

Lets take the first entry here.

The symbol index is 1 and relocation type is 6.

* `R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT` does require symbol lookup.
* This is a global data relocation, commonly used for symbol pointers in the GOT (Global Offset Table).\
  Its purpose is to fill a pointer with the runtime address of a symbol â€” typically function pointers or global variables imported from shared libraries.

The symbol is `__libc_start_main.`&#x20;

The relocation logic is&#x20;

```
*(base_addr + 0x3fc0) = address_of(__libc_start_main)
```

The symbol is looked up in all the loaded shared libraries using the dynamic symbol table and the symbol hash tables. Once the runtime address is found in memory, the address is written in place of `0x3fc0` in the global offset table. And the relocation is done.

The term **global offset table** is new here.

We are done with `.rela.dyn` relocations.

Now the interpreter jumps to the `JUMPREL` entry in the dynamic section and finds `.rela.plt`. The real chaos starts here.

* PLT entries are about lazy binding, by default.
* For lazy binding, we need to understand global offset table (GOT) and procedure linkage table (PLT). Both of which are really complex and confusing.
* Since it is fairly long, it deserves its own separate place. Therefore, we are dividing this article into two parts.
* Here ends the first part.
