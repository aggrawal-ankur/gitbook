Everyone can learn systems if they are willing to put in the work. But hard work is not enough. We need a path to follow.

When I was starting my journey, I didn't find a path that suites my learning process. After wasting 1 year passively and 4 months actively, I decided to construct it myself while walking it.

I doing this since May 01, 2025.

Operating systems has evolved for decades since 1970. It is October 07, 2025. 55 years is a lot of time.
  - It is not something we can learn lineraly.
  - It's an interconnected web of concepts relying on each other.

But humans learn lineraly, topic by topic. It is hard to keep track of more than 2-3 things for an average person. At least I couldn't do it until this journey forced me to.

My idea is to start linearly so that we are not against the nature. And later evolve as how operating systems actually exist.

Rote learning and poor education system has messed up our brain and it's time to solve that problem.

When we move linearly up until a threshold, it rebuilds that internal map of navigation. Once it is build enough that it can function, it alives and you no longer need anything except a strong feedback system which defines correct and incorrect.

As of October 07, 2025, I have rebuilt both my internal map and an internal feedback system.

The systems itself is my feedback system because it works when I am right, it doesn't when I am wrong and it gives an undefined behavior when I am partially right/wrong.

The more I live with systems, the stronger, straightforward and blunt the feedback gets. And this keeps me grounded and helps me correct my mental model at incredible speed.
