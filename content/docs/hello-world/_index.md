Everyone starts their coding journey with `Hello, World!`. It takes only 4 lines to do this in C:

```c {filename="hello.c"}
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void){
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

But how does it really work? Let's find out.

**Note: It's a complete rabbit hole. And this exploration will prove that *hello-ing* the world is not that easy.**

Itâ€™s going to be a long journey, so sit tight and enjoy.
