Without wasting time, let's jump right into experiments.

## Setup

I started my low level journey on May 01, 2025. Today, it is September 25, 2025. Almost 5 months are about to complete. In these 5 months, I have understood lot of theoretical concepts. I tried to visualize them using ASCII and other mechanisms but I have not seen them practically.

So the idea is to make a list of all the concepts I have studied so far, write small programs to implement them, load them inside gdb and examine how that theory is implemented practically, to verify if what I read was right or not.

The list below includes everything.
