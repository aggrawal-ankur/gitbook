Finally, the switch to GitHub Pages + Hugo + Hextra is done.

GitHub Actions workflow is also working fine, changes are visible now. Changed the username as well as the previous one (hi-anki) was not appropriate now. Testing deployment one last time before going to bed.

Still there is a lot of work to be done and I will continue tomorrow.

Why I switched to GitHub Pages by the way?
