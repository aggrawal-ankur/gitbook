*Got the idea to manage this on October 06, 2025*

I started my journey in August 2024.

## August 2024 - Digital Detox - January 2025

Decided to perform a complete digital media detox.

Have already quit Instagram on December 16, 2023 and Snapchat in February 2024.

But their effect was still in me.
  - All day I am humming songs.
  - Bad reels running in my mind.

I was not able to think or sit silently.

***I decided that until I cleanse my mind completely, I will not study CS. From today on wards, I will take my decisions myself and I deserve complete accountability.***

This was the first most important decision taken solely by myself.

I asked as many dumb questions as I can. I explored every single thing to find their answer.
  - Religious books.
  - Philosophy.
  - Psychology.
  - Sociology.
  - Quotes from famous people.
  - Lots of podcasts.
  - Motivational videos

In this journey, I've found great figures from history and present time, notably: David Goggins and Naval Ravikant.

I also revisited my school teachers advices as they now I really need them to progress in life. They are the key to success.

And most importantly, I visited the best teacher from history that I never had, ***Acharaya Vishnugupta Chanakya***.

Maybe, some day in future, I share the lessons I had in these 5 months.

Mission accomplished on January 15, 2025.

## January 2025 - Finding my way - April 2025

To patch this void, I started learning web application penetration testing again, because it has the least entry barrier and a lot of content available online.

I worked hard on Tryhackme and PortSwigger Labs, but I wasn't feeling good. It wasn't the right field for me.

I quit the usual path to WebAppSec and started a personal project.

---

It was aimed at creating a realistic social media platform like Instagram and make every part of it hackable in a crazy amount of ways.

I was able to build a fully hackable login page, which supported multiple techniques like rainbow tables, brute forcing, optimized brute forcing based on certain information, rate limiting etc.

I worked on it for 3 weeks in April and I hit he wall again. It wasn't interesting at all. I wasted 10 days in April until I took the next decision, the second most important decision in my life, the deciding one.

---

Back in 2015, when I was in 5th grade, my father purchased the first ever touch screen mobile in winters.

Internet was crazy expensive at that time. I remember going to shops and getting a 50 INR recharge which buys 39 rupees. And it was x-paisa per call. Only in summer vacations and Deepawali (the festival of lights) do we get an internet recharge, which costed 350 INR for 1 GB. Yes, 1 GB.

Back then, 1$ = 66.79 INR (according to internet).

My friends told me about Clash of Clans game and it was a fantastic game. Before that, I used to play Hill Climb Racing, Subway Surfers, Temple Run, Temple Run OZ, Doraemon Repair Shop and other offline games.

At that time, luck patcher was very famous to mod games. However, I could never use it.

One day, my friends gave me a challenge to find a mod version of Clash of Clans, which was according to them not possible. I found and gave them the name, Clash of Nulls. Anyways.

That's how I was introduced to hacking. But nothing happened after that. I continued my studies.

In 2020, when quarantine happened, one day, maybe it was September 09, 2020, my mother asked me which stream I am aligning with as the next year I have to choose b/w math/bio/arts as I was entering into senior secondary schooling.
  - I replied, I want to do ethical hacking.
  - I don't want to study anymore.

But I am glad my mother explained it to me and I continued my studies.

---

A deep system level ethical hacking was what that ignited the spark 8 years back. And I decided to pursue that path.

I was avoiding it so far because there was no clear roadmap in sight. But this time, I decided I am gonna navigate the plane myself.

I asked ChatGPT to help me. And we came on a decision that I should with x64 assembly.

## May 2025 - x86_64 Assembly

For one complete month, I studied x64 assembly.

I used Chat GPT heavily as there was no way I could read [Felix Cloutier](https://www.felixcloutier.com/), let alone formal documentations.

## June 2025 - On A Long Journey - July 2026

Now I was blank again. There was no way forward.

I ask ChatGPT again and we finally agreed upon pwn.college and I started practicing on it. Once again, I diagnosed with "not making any sense" syndrome.

I was so fed up in this month that very bad decisions were running in my mind. Thanks to the learnings I had in the first five months. They saved me from destroying my progress and myself.

I also found Sir Richard Feynman this month and he's the person who kept me sane this month.

This time I had enough and I took the third most important decision of my life. ***I decided to explore RE myself. I decided to create the roadmap that I didn't got.***

I wrote simple C programs like hello world and calculator and decided to explore them at bit level myself.

I hopped on this journey on June 21, 2025 and it took 35 days to understand 4 lines of hello world.

I end that journey on 25 July and immediately started a new one.

---

I wanted a tool that could display ELF information in C-style structs. Although `dumpelf` from `pax-utils` existed but I decided to create my own.

The first commit was on July 25 and the last commit on August 03. It took 9 days to complete it when I anticipated at least 2 weeks.

Although a lot of improvements can be made to it but I left it as is as the goal was accomplished, which was to understand ELF more deeply.

It was the first time when I properly made some effort in reading Oracle's linker and libraries guide. Although it was completely boring because it had no drawings in it, just kidding.

## August 2025 - Assembly and Low Level Stuff - September 2025

One year passed.

I brought my assembly notes on GitBook and started polishing them. I have also explored new low level stuff like virtual memory in this time period.

After completing the assembly part, I dive deep into dlmalloc to understand the foundation of dynamic memory allocation.

Finished `dlmalloc` theory on September 20, 2025.

To verify this humongous theory, I started debugging once I completed dlmalloc.

I started polishing my write ups to find pieces of theory to verify with gdb. Then I came across hello world. And that sucked my focus. I started polishing the static notes.

I have invested 5 days from Sep 21 to Sep 25 in debugging, then I started hello world polishing.

One September 26, 2025, I had enough of GitBook issues and I ported to Hugo + Hextra on GitHub Pages.

27, 28, and 29 September went in setting up the environment. And other days followed in scripting away the problems while I was simultaneously polishing my write ups.

## October 2025

### October 06, 2025

Finally, as of writing this, it is October 06, 2025. Just in evening at 7 PM IST, I finished the last polish of the static notes. Now I am tasked with an even bigger restructuring. And I think that it will easily take this week if extra problems don't come.

I also got the idea to manage a page for what I am doing now. Next I am gonna write that.

### October 07, 2025

I am anticipating a lot of changes in my write ups, therefore, now I have decided to actively work on the articulation part. No more wrong English.

The first step I have taken is to install a spell checker extension in VS Code.
