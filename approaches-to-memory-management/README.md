# Approaches To Memory Management

_**August 12, 2025**_

While exploring memory, I explored what stack and heap actually is at memory level. There I understood that these are just two approaches to manage memory. As simple as that.

But as I dived into them "as an approach", I quickly reached the limit of the scope I was exploring them at. Therefore, I have decided to put them in a separate place.

This also keeps the idea of "memory management approaches" further extensible. I can explore other approaches as well as there are plenty.
