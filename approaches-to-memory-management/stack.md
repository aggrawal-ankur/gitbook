# Stack

Stack visualizes memory in sequential order.

* It assumes to manage the memory with a **last-in, first-out** mindset. What comes first leaves last and what comes last leaves first.
* To manage memory this way, it has two fundamental operations, called **push** and **pop**. Push populates the stack or allocates the memory. Pop frees the existing memory in use.
* Each allocation in stack is independent.
* Both of these operations are byte-addressable. Meaning, push and pop operates on one address at a time. You can't pop the entire stack in one pop operation, neither can you pop 10 things in push operation.
