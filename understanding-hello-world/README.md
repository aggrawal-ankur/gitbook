# Understanding Hello, World!

Everyone starts their coding journey with a `Hello, World!\n` program.

For example, it takes only 4 lines to do this in C:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

But how does it really works? This is what we are going to understand here.

It is really complex, but equally magnificent. Creating on single article would make it boring as it is very long. Therefore, it would come in a series of articles, which are in proper order.

1. A high level overview of the build process.
2. Introduction to ELF format
3. Introduction to processes in Linux
