# Object Code

## What is object code?

Object code is a machine-readable representation of source code, typically the output of a compiler or assembler.

In Linux, it follows a specific file format, called **Executable and Linkable File** format.

To obtain object code for our source code, run

```c
gcc -c hello.c -o hello.o
```
