# Lets talk about \`gcc\`

In the previous article, we have used a program called `gcc` to compile our source code. And we have introduced it as **GNU C Compiler**. While this is not wrong, it is not right either.

* If you search _"what is `gcc` in C"_ you are almost certain to find the definition that gcc stands for **GNU Compiler Collection**.
* If you visit the man7 page for `gcc`, in the colophon, you can find that it also says **GNU Compiler Collection**.

Why?

I don't have a story right now, but I just saw a video on YouTube, which explained this to me. The reason is directly visible but I never took it that way.

You can see the video here, [Why some projects use multiple programming languages?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJC5WB2Bwrc) A fantastic video about low level engineering.
