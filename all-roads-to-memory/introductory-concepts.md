# Introductory Concepts

## Physical Memory

Physical memory refers to the actual RAM chip installed in your computer as a hardware unit.

It is the hardware storage where program data and instructions are loaded before executing.

Physical memory is **byte-addressable**, which means, every physical memory address refers to a single byte.

Addresses start from 0 and go up to `total RAM size - 1`.

## Virtual Address Space

Each process is isolated in nature. This isolation is achieved by the concept of virtual address space.

When we do static analysis or even dynamic analysis, the addresses we see are usually the address in virtual address space.

## Memory Management Unit (or MMU)

As named, it manages virtual address space and physical address space and everything else about the memory.
