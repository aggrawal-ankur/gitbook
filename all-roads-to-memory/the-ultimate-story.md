# The Ultimate Story

We are going to use lot of imagination here. So be ready.

***

There is a **platform** created by the ministry of railways to manage trains. There are thousands of trains and the platform has details of every train running across the country.

There is a train which starts from New Delhi, the capital of India, and touches Agra, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Nagpur, Kurnool, Dharwad, before its final destination KSR Bengaluru.

The train starts it journey at 10 AM IST from New Delhi and reaches KSR Bengaluru at 4 PM IST the next day, taking 30 hours in total.

This train comes with 10 bogies and one engine, where each bogie has a capacity of 100 passengers. So, 1000 passengers can travel in that train at the same time.

Not everyone reserves a seat for a full New Delhi to Bengaluru journey, some reserves seat for middle stations as well. Like from Agra to Nagpur.

The fair also depends on the journey. If you book from New Delhi to Bengaluru, it will cost the most while Agra to Nagpur will cost lesser.

Ticket reservation is a very volatile process.

* One might book a ticket today and cancel it before the train even departs, days before.
* One might book a ticket hours before the train departs from their station.
* As the population is quite high in India, some might prefer advance reservation, as advance as months before or a few weeks.
* Business related trips might book a "tatkal ticket", which translates to "immediate ticket reservation".

All in all, it's a pretty complicated process.

The ticketing platform doesn't directly displays for what stations a seat is booked for.

* If I wanted a ticket for Delhi to Gwalior, I might not get it. But if I asked for Delhi to Agra, there is a high chance I get it.

And this creates a loss of revenue for the ticketing platform. For them, the best case is when a seat is booked all the way from New Delhi to KSR Bengaluru. These in-between causes revenue loss because now the seat becomes available for a duration no one is there to occupy.

* If I wanted Delhi to Gwalior, which is not available, and Delhi to Agra is available, which is not what I requested for, that Agra to Gwalior gap will eat their revenue as I will not book.
* If a person booked ticket from Jabalpur to Nagpur, now that seat is occupied only for a few hours but it will be shown as occupied to a person who wants a full trip.

These are the revenue loses.
